# NCAA STAT PROCESSOR
----

The National Colleget Athletics Associatioin (NCAA) provided graduation information for all of their member insitutions. This information is provided for each of the individual school. This console application reads a CSV file, aquired from the NCAA website, containing all the schools'graduation information, then aggrigates and averages the data from the College-level to generate conference-level statistics for the conference chosen by the user. It is then saved as a JSON file.

## Usage

### Registration
A new user will need to register and create a username and password. This user account will also store the user's favorite football and primary conferences for convinience. This profile is stored in user.db .

### Login
If a user already has a username, they may login using their existing user account.

### Main Menu
1. Display Individual School Stats by Football Conference
Displays a list of NCAA FOOTBALL conferences. The user then selects one and the a Conference object is instantiated that will contain the totals and averages derived from the school-level data. It will then save a JSON file containing the results.
2. Display Individual School Stats by Primary Conference
Displays a list of NCAA PRIMARY conferences. The user then selects one and the a Conference object is instantiated that will contain the totals and averages derived from the school-level data. It will then save a JSON file containing the results.
3. Display Favorite Football Conference
The same functionality as number 1 except it process the user's favorite FOOTBALL conference.

...
6. Edit Profile
This allows the user to edit their profile. Username cannot be changed, as it is the primary key of the user.db file.
7. Delete Profile
This allows the user to delete their profile and dumps them out at the login menu.
...

This allows the user to exit out of the program.

## Dependenacies
This C# application makes use of SQLite, LINQ, and its ADO.net provider for the user registration and statistical functions.
It also uses Newtonsoft's JSON functionality to write the aggregated data to a new file.


## Data Scrubbing
Each line in the CSV began with a leading comma. Also, the names of some colleges contained commas. These had to be manually removed.
